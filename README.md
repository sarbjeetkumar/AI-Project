## Deployment

There are two methods of deployment **Eclipse IDE  or CMD line**. The command line method is faster because you only need to install java.

* **Eclipse**          
Launch Eclipse and set the workspace as the root folder that was extracted from the GitHub project. Select the folder using the Eclipse popup window browse button. Create a new project File tab --> New --> Project --> Java Project and name it **AI-Project**. This is the name of the folder containing the project, Eclipse will pull in the files into the created project. Run the project by selecting the Run tab --> Run.

* **Command Line**          
Launch the command Line and navigate to the src folder inside the project folder. Root folder --> Reflection --> src. Once inside the src folder run the command **javac ie/gmit/sw/*.java** to compile all the java classes. Then run the application with the command **java ie.gmit.sw.GameRunner**.
